MailArchive 1.9
===============

MailArchive is a Perl script which processes mail messages
and stores them in a sort of archive provided with an hypertext index.
The index is formatted in HTML (HyperText Markup Language) so that
the archive can be managed by an HTTP server (such as NCSA httpd) and
accessed by a WWW browser such as Lynx, Mosaic, Netscape, etc.
The script optionally supports the creation and maintenance of a reverse
index so that very efficient textual searches can be performed.
The output of the search procedure is also HTML.
MailArchive may be used to ease the organization of any kind of pieces
of information which must be accessed by WWW browsers.

HISTORY
=======

Version 1.8.22               First public release, August 1995

Version 1.9                  Debug release, December 1995
                             Fixed a bug in expiration date parsing: Jan
                             was rejected as incorrect month specification.
                             Fixed a bug which prevented the use of the
                             "!Subject:" line into the text.

                             The middle digit in version number has been
                             eliminated. Version 1.9 is immediately
                             following version 1.8.22. The next minor
                             (debug) release will be Version 1.10. The
                             next major release will be Version 2.0.
